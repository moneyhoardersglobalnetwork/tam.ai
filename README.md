**T.A.M. is an advanced AI LLM that can instantly summarize, analyze, and translate any text powered by Google Gemini.** Think of it as a superpowered research assistant:

## Inspiration
The A.I space is blowing up and you really can't turn a corner without running into some form. Google has as been the leading search engine and with A.I becoming more widely adopted MHGN has decide work with Google in developing and training models.  

## What it does
## Tired of drowning in information overload? Meet T.A.M., is a informational text analysis expert.

**T.A.M. is an advanced AI model that can instantly summarize, analyze, and translate any text, no matter how long or complex.** Think of it as a superpowered research assistant who can:

* **Uncover hidden insights** by identifying key themes, sentiment, and patterns in your data.
* **Save you time** by summarizing lengthy documents in seconds, providing you with the essential information.
* **Unlock new opportunities** by translating languages, translating content into different styles, and creating engaging content.

**Whether you're a researcher, marketer, student, or simply overwhelmed by information, T.A.M. is your key to efficient and insightful text analysis.**

T.A.M is simple, but powerful for streamlining productivity. Along with MHGN's other projects T.A.M will help ecosystem participants to find and create value MHGN's core mission.  
The ability for T.A.M to help developers write new code logic can help move project development at a faster speed.

## How we built it
Using the resources given we utilized the Prompt API chrome extension example. We then modifed the appearance slightly to appeal to users. We are planning to offer T.A.M standalone as a chrome extension and also link with the MHGN Hoarding Gateway so that T.A.M will be avaliable to the ecosystem for R&D.

## Challenges we ran into
First time working with chrome extensions and wanted to work on web3 wallet integrations for side panel.
We found it difficult to integrated web3 wallet login for T.A.M by hackathon deadline and we will update on any changes.
We may not be able to connect users wallets in side-panel, but progress was made through trail and error.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
MHGN Hoarder Labs has come a long way since first join the Devpost platform and as we move into the A.I space it has been a great learning process. We feel very accomplished in the Web3 world with the BOP token live on Polygon Network and believe this integration will move the protocol to new levels.

## What we learned
How to interact with the new Google API's and got a better understanding of LLM's.
How the sidePanel works in chrome extensions.

## What's next for Text Analysis Model "T.A.M"
We will continue you build T.A.M and integrate with other MHGN projects in the blockchain space. We plan to reinvest rewards to incentivize freelance developers and users to join our community and help build innovative applications using Google Gemini. Rewards would also go towards purchasing better hardware so that MHGN Hoarder Labs can keep up with the demand of the growing technology in the Web3 and A.I sectors. We would also like to market MHGN Hoarder Labs products like BOP by MHGN a digital smart asset developed for MHGN ecosystem on-boarding, education and rewards. We like to call Blocks of Passion Protocol "The gift that keeps on giving!" a learn and earn and hack to earn project. T.A.M will play a major role in the MHGN ecosystem as we integrate withe Gemini live technology. We are still working on wallet connections for web3 in the sidepanel and moving on to more complex builds.

## Try T.A.M extension on your local machine here's how:

1. Clone this repo

2. yarn install (This will update the package-lock.json and node_modules)

3. You will need to get a personal API key https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey?_gl=1*1u5q22b*_ga*MTIzMzk1ODI2MC4xNzI4MjI1MTU3*_ga_P1DBVKWT6V*MTczMzExNDU2Ny42LjEuMTczMzExNDYwMS4yNi4wLjE3MjQ1NzYyNzQ.

You will then add your API key to index.js file this will allow access for queries.

4. npm run build (Should create dist/sidepanel.bundle.js)

5. Go to extensions in your browser then click manage extensions.

6. Turn on developer mode.

7. Proceed to Load unpacked extension then navigate to the tam.ai folder and select.

8. T.A.M is now avaliable to add to extensions bar then just click on the T.A.M icon.


9. Enter a prompt and T.A.M will give you a response.

10. Use cases for applications like T.A.M are open-ended so developers and users can explore and leverage T.A.M to create value.
